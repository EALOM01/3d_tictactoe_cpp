# 3d_tictactoe_cpp
A 3d tictactoe game in C++

Thank you for viewing my simple console app game in C++.
This was a project I had in Spring semester 2017.

RULES:
1) please view the rules in-game before playing.
2) while playing, to enter a spot, type in the letter corresponding to the space the character is occupying.
3) Rinse and repeat until victory (or not...)
